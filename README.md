## Team Members:

1. Aakash Singh (Roll No.: 2100290109001)
2. Lalit Kishor (Roll No.: 2200290109008)
3. Suhel Khan (Roll No.: 2200290109016)

## Steps for Execution:

1. **Prepare the Dataset**
   - Source a heart disease dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or UCI repository).
   - Ensure the dataset contains necessary clinical features such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values (e.g., via mean or median imputation).
   - Normalize data using techniques like Min-Max or Z-score scaling.
   - Perform feature selection using correlation analysis or PCA.

3. **Model Development**
   - Implement the Random Forest algorithm using Python (preferably in Jupyter Notebook).
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train the model using selected features.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model using metrics: Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, and AUC.
   - Confirm model performance (Random Forest should reach ~89.92% accuracy).

5. **Web Interface Development**
   - Build a frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user input.
   - Backend in Python to handle prediction requests via the trained model.

6. **Integration**
   - Serialize the trained model (e.g., using Pickle).
   - Connect frontend inputs to backend API for real-time prediction.
   - Display results (disease risk: Yes/No) to the user based on input features.

7. **Final Testing**
   - Test the web application with various sample inputs.
   - Validate outputs for consistency and correctness.

8. **Presentation**
   - Prepare a PowerPoint presentation summarizing objectives, methodology, results, and future scope.
